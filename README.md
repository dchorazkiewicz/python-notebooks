This tutorial is made for scientists who want to learn Python and eventually step from Matlab.

Python is a general programming language with many scientific libraries. 
It is optimized to be easy to develop in. The same is not true for Matlab which is 
a domain-specific language.

1. Install [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) 

2.  Download this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/pnavaro/python-notebooks.git
```

or download as a [zip file](https://github.com/pnavaro/python-notebooks/archive/master.zip).
    
3. Create a new conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml -n python-navaro
source activate python-navaro  # Linux OS/X
activate python-navaro         # Windows
```

4. If you have an existing installation of Jupyter install the new kernel with:

```
conda run -n python-navaro python -m ipykernel install --user --name python-navaro 
```

5. Open notebooks with:

```
cd python-notebooks
jupyter notebook
```
